## Summary
The manual generation of match highlights by splicing and editing the match video is passe. 

This repository holds the source code to automatically generate the match highlights by simply providing the complete match video and the minute-wise text commentry.

Our engine goes through each minute of the text commentry and decides which minute to include into the highlights.

## Next Milestone:
1. Personalize the highlights generated by allowing users to input keywords they'll want to see/hear.
2. Improve the audio analysis.
